<p>Plus3 is a project to bring positivity back to your daily routine. I believe in the below tenets:</p>

<ul>
<li>Happiness is the end goal in life, and is different than 'success'</li>
<li>Happiness in and of itself can lend the user a better, more fulfilling life - therefore it's a catalyst for 'success'</li>
<li>Happiness is contagious, and any happiness, small or large, can make a meaningful difference. </li>
</ul>

<a id="creation--ideation" class="anchor" href="#creation--ideation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creation / Ideation</h3>

<p>Plus3 was created at first, by accident. I was working a very unforgiving position as a Call Center Collections Representative. This position requires that you handle around 70 calls from distressed homeowners every day, oftentimes having to ask them for their payments. </p>

<p>This atmosphere of many customers, high stress, and long hours resulted in my productivity taking a dive as well as my happiness. To rectify this, I began keeping a 'journal' of sorts, divided into four parts:</p>

<h1>
<a id="insert-image-here-demonstrating-notebook" class="anchor" href="#insert-image-here-demonstrating-notebook" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>INSERT IMAGE HERE DEMONSTRATING NOTEBOOK</h1>

<p>The four parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>TODO / TODONOW:</strong> These are fairly basic, you do anything in this quadrant by the priority assigned, with TODONOWs above all else.</li>
<li>
<strong>WYL / What You Learned:</strong> This is a very important section for unrelated reasons - I believe it creates a signifigant uptick in retention and 'pomodoro assimilation'. This is achieved by recapping the most important theories and ideas you've learned for the day, allowing you to scroll back in your journal to view your notes on the corresponding topic.</li>
<li>
<strong>NOTES:</strong> This one is obvious - a general scratchpad for things without priority or not quite ready to be developed into a true idea.</li>
<li>
<strong>+3:</strong> My favorite part, and last for a reason. Let's expand on this below:</li>
</ol>

<p>The Plus3 method can be summarized briefly in one sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>+3 is a three-item list that compiles three things from the preceding day that caused feelings of joy, &gt;happiness, friendship, accomplishment, skill, progress or love.</p>
